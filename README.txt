To Be Developed
------------------
[]Handle Wrong Input
  by displaying an error to the user with the EditText 
[]Paint the cells black and white 
[]Paint the cells with colors and update UI after solved button was clicked
[]Data Binding
[]Board display screen should maybe have zoom in or scroll
  or some ui feature to allow user to understand large boards 
  (for example, 1000X1000 would just look black since there is not enough spacing)
[]Determine if result already calculated. 
  If so, return it without re-calculating
